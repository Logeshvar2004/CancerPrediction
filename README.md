This project is a real-time machine learning predictor that has been trained on a dataset of over 400 records. By collecting various data on the likelihood of cancer attacks, it can predict whether an individual has breast cancer or not.

Algorithm Used:

1) Random Forest Classifier (which i've got best accuracy)
2) K-NearestNeighbour (KNN)
3) Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Technology used: Sklearn
